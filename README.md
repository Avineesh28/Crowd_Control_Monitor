**Crowd Control Monitor**

In response to the increasing number of Covid-19 cases globally, maintaining social distancing has emerged as a critical safety measure. The recommended minimum distance of 6 feet between individuals is challenging to enforce in crowded public places such as malls and stores. Traditional methods of manual crowd management or visitor counting are labor-intensive and inefficient. Addressing this challenge, our project aims to develop a solution using **Computer Vision technology** to automate crowd monitoring, enabling real-time counting of people in stores or malls.

### Project Goals and Features:

- **Real-Time Crowd Counting:** Utilizing CCTV camera feeds in real-time, our system employs *Computer Vision algorithms* to accurately count the number of people entering and leaving a designated area.

- **Automated Alert System:** When the maximum allowed capacity is reached, the system automatically alerts the authorities, enabling timely intervention to maintain social distancing norms.

- **Cost-Effective Solution:** Leveraging existing CCTV infrastructure in stores eliminates the need for substantial additional hardware investments, making the solution financially viable.

- **Scalability:** The project design allows seamless scalability, enabling its application in larger regions and diverse public spaces beyond individual stores, contributing to community-wide safety efforts.

- **Optimized Real-Time Stream:** Implementation of threading and optimization techniques ensures efficient processing of the real-time camera feed, enhancing system performance.

- **User-Friendly Features:** Integrated schedulers and timers simplify management tasks for storekeepers, streamlining their responsibilities and enhancing operational efficiency.

- **Footfall Analysis:** The collected data not only aids in social distancing enforcement but also provides valuable insights for footfall analysis, supporting business strategies and decision-making.

By addressing the challenge of crowd management in public places, our project serves as a significant step towards mitigating the spread of Covid-19, ensuring public safety, and contributing to the overall well-being of communities.
